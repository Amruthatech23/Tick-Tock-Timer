1. HTML to create the structure (time display and buttons).


2. CSS to style the stopwatch with flexbox and button hover effects.


3. JavaScript to control:

setInterval() for time updates

clearInterval() to stop timer

DOM updates to display time in real-time


# What I Learned

How to use setInterval() and clearInterval()

Updating DOM elements dynamically

Handling button events with addEventListener or onclick

Time logic: incrementing seconds, minutes, and hours
